## **INTERNSHIP**
### **Guangzhou Yunke Information Technology Co., Ltd.**  
**Intern of Backend Development**  
*06-08/2025*  

1. **Development and optimization of APIs for the logistics management module of the company’s SaaS ERP system**  
   - Assisted in developing core APIs such as **driver QR code check-in** and **vehicle transport statistics**; conducted self-testing via Postman and collaborated with QA teams to carry out functional validation  
   - Learned and utilized the **Spring Boot framework** to implement API logic, optimized data processing logic via **Java Collections Utility Classes**; assisted in developing APIs for logistics tracking using **thread pools** to handle concurrent data writes, enabling scheduled reception and storage of vehicle GPS data  
   - **Troubleshot ‘slow generation of weighing data report’** by identifying unindexed join queries via slow query logs; **shortened report generation time from 15 minutes to 3 minutes**  

2. **Development of the data interaction layer of the company’s LED vehicle queuing system**  
   - Learned the use of **Redis string and hash structures**, and assisted in building a **Redis cache basic model** for storing temporary data of vehicle queuing status  
   - Wrote **scheduled task scripts** to automatically synchronize queuing information to the Redis cache every 5 minutes, reducing database query pressure  
   - Studied **distributed locks** to solve the problem of dirty data caused by multi-threaded modification, supporting **high-concurrency real-time updates**

## **PROJECTS**
### **Construction of Large Language Model Inference System**
*02-06/2025*  
- Built a **multi-model architecture** (Mistral-7B, Yi-34B, LLaMA 2) using **Zero-shot, Few-shot, and SFT fine-tuning**, optimized via **H2O LLM Studio** → **accuracy improved by 10%** in physics/biology  
- Used **LoRA fine-tuning** and cached **past_key_values**, increasing **inference speed by 60%**  
- Integrated **RAG + LangChain** with a **60M-paragraph Wikipedia corpus** and **FAISS vector retrieval**, using multi-round prompt templates  
- Implemented **confidence integration** (TF-IDF re-ranking + embedding similarity) → **Top3 hit rate 93%**; **integrated model 15% more accurate** than single model  

### **Identification of Offensive Language in Chinese Social Media Environment**  
*10-12/2024*  
- Collected, cleaned, and annotated **Chinese social media data**; built datasets **COLD, ToxiCN, ToxiCloakCN**  
- Built **LSTM, BERT, RoBERTa** models for offensive language detection  
- Evaluated via **Accuracy, ROC-AUC, F1-score**; selected **RoBERTa** achieving **78.54% accuracy**  

### **Predictive Analysis of Diamond Prices**  
*05-06/2024*  
- Used **Python & R** to model **5000 transaction records** for **diamond price prediction**  
- Conducted **data cleaning, feature engineering, Box-Cox transformation**  
- Applied **stepwise regression + cross-validation** → **R² = 0.9853**, **RMSE = 0.1308**  
- Model passed **residual independence, normality, and homoscedasticity tests**  

### **Processing and Analyzing of Earthquake Data (1900–2023)**  
*03-05/2023*  
- Used **Hadoop + Spark** for large-scale earthquake data processing  
- Performed **data cleaning, reverse geocoding**, spatiotemporal analysis  
- Visualized via **Plotly, WordCloud**, showing hotspots and key seismic event patterns
