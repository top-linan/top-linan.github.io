**Hi, I'm Linan Wu.**  
BSc (Hons) in Data Science @ BNBU (GPA 3.7/4.0), Minor in Economics (GPA 3.8/4.0).  
Awards: Guangdong Provincial 3rd Prize — CUMCM 2024; BNBU Second-tier Scholarship (2022–23, 2023–24).


## Internship

- **Guangzhou Yunke Information Technology Co., Ltd.**  
  *Intern of Backend Development* (06–08/2025)

  1. Participated in the development and optimization of APIs for the logistics management module of the company’s SaaS ERP system  
     - Assisted in developing core APIs such as driver QR code check-in and vehicle transport statistics; conducted self-testing via Postman and collaborated with QA teams to carry out functional validation  
     - Learned and utilized the Spring Boot framework to implement API logic, and optimized data processing logic via Java Collections Utility Classes; assisted in developing fundamental APIs for logistics tracking by using thread pools to handle concurrent data writes, enabling scheduled reception and storage of vehicle GPS data  
     - Assisted in troubleshooting the problem of “slow generation of weighing data report” by identifying unindexed join queries through analysis of slow query logs; shortened the report generation time from 15 minutes to 3 minutes  

  2. Participated in the development of the data interaction layer of the company’s LED vehicle queuing system  
     - Learned the use of Redis string and hash structures, and assisted in building a Redis cache model for storing temporary data of vehicle queuing status  
     - Wrote scheduled task scripts to automatically synchronize queuing information to the Redis cache every 5 minutes, reducing query pressure on the database  
     - Studied the use of distributed locks to solve the problem of dirty data caused by multiple threads modifying queuing numbers concurrently, addressing the high-concurrency scenario of real-time updates to vehicle queuing information


## Projects

### Construction of Large Language Model Inference System  
*02–06/2025*  

Aimed to build a high-accuracy large language model inference system to answer complex natural science multiple-choice questions generated by GPT-3.5.

- Built a multi-model architecture based on open-source models such as **Mistral-7B, Yi-34B, and LLaMA 2**, using Zero-shot, Few-shot, and SFT fine-tuning strategies (with H2O LLM Studio), achieving >10% accuracy improvement in physics/biology domains.  
- Used **LoRA** fine-tuning and cached `past_key_values`, increasing inference speed by **60%**.  
- Integrated **RAG** and LangChain with a **60M-paragraph Wikipedia corpus**, developed a FAISS vector retrieval system, and designed multi-round Prompt templates.  
- Implemented confidence integration and methods such as **TF-IDF re-ranking** and **embedding similarity**, raising Top-3 hit rate to **93%**; integrated model was **15%** more accurate than any single model.

### Identification of Offensive Language in Chinese Social Media Environment  
*10–12/2024*  

Aimed to build an automated detection system for implicit/explicit offensive remarks in Chinese social media.

- Collected, cleaned, and annotated Chinese datasets (**COLD, ToxiCN, ToxiCloakCN**).  
- Trained **LSTM, BERT, and RoBERTa** models; final **RoBERTa** model reached **78.54% accuracy**, performing robustly on complex language.  
- Evaluated models via **Accuracy, ROC-AUC, F1-score**, selecting RoBERTa as optimal.

### Predictive Analysis of Diamond Prices  
*05–06/2024*  

Used Python and R to model and analyze 5000 diamond transaction records, aiming for high-precision price prediction.

- Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and **Box-Cox transformation**.  
- Identified multicollinearity via visualization, improved prediction accuracy.  
- Applied **stepwise regression** + **cross-validation** → final model: **R²=0.9853**, **CV RMSE=0.1308**.  
- Passed regression assumption tests (residual independence, normality, homoscedasticity).

### Processing and Analyzing Earthquake Data (1900–2023)  
*03–05/2023*  

Applied big data and distributed computing for seismic data analysis and risk insights.

- Used **Hadoop/Spark** for storage & parallel processing of long time-series earthquake data.  
- Performed data cleaning, standardized time formats, applied reverse geocoding for geographic info.  
- Analyzed spatiotemporal patterns and visualized results with **Plotly** and **WordCloud**.
